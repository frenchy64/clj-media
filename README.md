# clj-media

Read, write, and transform audio and video with Clojure.

Powered by [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) and [clong](https://github.com/phronmophobic/clong).


## Dependency

```clojure
com.phronemophobic/clj-media {:mvn/version "2.2"}
```

## Documentation

[Guide](https://phronmophobic.github.io/clj-media/)  
[API docs](https://phronmophobic.github.io/clj-media/reference/)

## Locally compiled FFmpeg

clj-media also supports using a locally compiled FFmpeg build.

Example compilation:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg.git
cd FFmpeg
./configure  --extra-ldflags='-Wl,-ld_classic' --enable-shared --prefix=`pwd`/build
make
make install
```

To use the local build:
1. Add the libraries to the JNA library path
2. Exclude the ffmpeg dependency, `org.bytedeco/ffmpeg-platform`

Example alias:
```edn
{:aliases
 {:local-ffmpeg
  {:jvm-opts ["-Djna.library.path=/path/to/FFmpeg/build/lib"]
   :deps {com.phronemophobic/clj-media {:mvn/version "2.2"
                                        :exclusions [org.bytedeco/ffmpeg-platform]}}}}}
```
